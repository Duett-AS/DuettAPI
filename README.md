<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Today, there are many systems that are poorly or not integrated. This creates a lot of duplication and inefficiency by having to register the same data in several systems. Many companies have invested heavily in integrations that create data flow between systems, but changes are often expensive to implement due to high complexity, which leads to change refusal and low flexibility.

Duett offers an API for creating effective and future-oriented integrations with Duett Economy. We have created an API that enables integration partners to deliver integration services faster and more cost-effectively than is possible with traditional integration development.

Become less dependent on systems and streamline everyday life. We help you get the systems to play together so that everyone can spend their time on value-creating tasks.

In this repo you will find ready-made codes that allow you to quickly reach your goal with your integration project. You can suggest changes and suggest new functionality in the discussion forum, or send us an e-mail to api@duett.no .
